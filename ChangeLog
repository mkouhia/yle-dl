  locales.

  (enabled in yle-dl by default). Long streams can now be downloaded
  in a single session.
- Replace characters in filenames that are illegal on certain
  filesystems.
- Fix buffer overflows. Code is now Valgrind-clean. Avoids crash if -o
  option given and the file exists.

  since 1.1).

24 Jul 2009, version 1.1.1

- Re-enable faster than real-time downloads by correctly setting
  the buffer size before connecting.

  to us without it. Also other changes that bring the generated RTMP
  packets closer to Areena flash player.

  Be quieter by default.

  frequently.

  Reijo Tomperi.
- Use the PREFIX defined in Makefile when calling rtmpdump-yle in
  yle-dl.
- It is now possible to download videos that require YLE passi by
  giving the Areena cookie with the --auth command line option.
- Append the optional parameters to the play packet only when their
  values differ from default. The server seems be less likely to drop
  connections this way.
- yle-dl now correctly quotes parameters that contains white space.

22 Jun 2009, version 1.0.2

- Fixed a memory corruption in MP3 URL parsing code caused by
  allocating too few bytes.

  file names.

- Avoid the temporary file by create the final destination file after
  receiving stream title but before starting downloading.
- Don't overwrite files: append an integer to file name, if the file
  already exists.
- When extracting clip ID, download the page if necessary. Now also
  program name URLs can be used in addition to clip ID URLs.

15 Jun 2009, version 1.0.1
